{-
    Write a Haskell program that accepts a string from the user and prints it 
    back in three different ways:

    With all letters in reverse.
    With words in reverse order, but letters within each word in the correct order.
    With all words in correct order, but letters reversed within the words.
    
    Output of your program should look like this:

    Please enter a string of text (the bigger the better): 
    The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.
    You entered "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.".
    Now jumble it:
    .nialp eht ni ylniam syats niapS ni niar ehT
    plain. the in mainly stays Spain in rain The
    ehT niar ni niapS syats ylniam ni eht .nialp
    
    
    There are a few Haskell functions that you may find handy when working on 
    this challenge. If you see something here that sounds useful, feel free to learn 
    more about it! You don't necessarily need any of them to write the program.
    
    reverse, words, unwords
