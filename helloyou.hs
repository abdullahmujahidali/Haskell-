{-
    The program below is a classic "Hello, world." program,
    written in Haskell. Modify the program so that instead of 
    saying, "Hello, world.", it asks the user for their
    name and then greets them by name. 
    
    See the example shown below:
    
    Hi, what's your name? 
    Eric
    Hello, Eric. It's great to see you!

main = do
    putStrLn "Hello, world!"
